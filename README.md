The World: Tower Defenders Roblox game script... first ever public WTD script! Very pro.

synapse.d.luau is types made by me that includes some of Synapse env that i use and some of FluentUI methods. Not finished. (use [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp))

Idiotic and shitty ass script patterns are expected. (english too)

ples contribute cause i dont work alone :sob:

The main script in **main.luau** file. You can edit it whatever you want, but give me credit atleast :(

I will add license soon.

Tools i used:
1. Solara (for dex explorer)
2. Swift (cause argon doesnt work for me :sob:) (also cant open dex explorer and have NO decompiler :sob:)

General support for solara and other shitty ass level 3 executor is not main goal because otherwise i need to use ðŸ¦½ to make a script. (nvm my ðŸ¦½ script ðŸ¦½ is ðŸ¦½ already ðŸ¦½ wheelchair ðŸ¦½)
