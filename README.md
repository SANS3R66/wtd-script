# About macroses
Macros are 100% accurate; wherever you place a unit, that's where it will be placed.

However! When recording macros that rely on money timing (for example, placing a unit at the exact moment you have enough money) - the macro might not work, because the great WTD randomness didn't want to give you the required amount of money. (actually fixed rn but dont abuse and ur macros will be good)

Macros are intended ONLY for single-player games. (Or, if you want to play with other players - they also need to do everything according to the script as it was when the macro was recorded).


# The World: Tower Defenders Roblox game script... first ever public WTD script! Very pro.

~synapse.d.luau is types made by me that includes some of Synapse env that i use and some of FluentUI methods. Not finished. (use [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp))~ (not supported anymore)

The main script in **main.luau** file. You can edit it whatever you want, but give me credit atleast :(

main.luau is not being supported as for now.
