# About macroses
Macros are 100% accurate; wherever you place a unit, that's where it will be placed.

However! When recording macros that rely on money timing (for example, placing a unit at the exact moment you have enough money) - the macro might not work, because the great WTD randomness didn't want to give you the required amount of money. (This will be fixed in the next update)

Macros are intended ONLY for single-player games. (Or, if you want to play with other players - they also need to do everything according to the script as it was when the macro was recorded).

Targeting/removing units is NOT implemented. Planned for the next update.


# The World: Tower Defenders Roblox game script... first ever public WTD script! Very pro.

synapse.d.luau is types made by me that includes some of Synapse env that i use and some of FluentUI methods. Not finished. (use [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp))

Idiotic and shitty ass script patterns are expected. (english too)

ples contribute cause i dont work alone :sob:

The main script in **main.luau** file. You can edit it whatever you want, but give me credit atleast :(

I will add license soon.

Tools im using:
1. Swift

(now only swift cause it got more stable)

General support for solara and other shitty ass level 3 executor is not main goal because otherwise i need to use ðŸ¦½ to make a script. (my ðŸ¦½ script ðŸ¦½ is ðŸ¦½ already ðŸ¦½ actually ðŸ¦½ wheelchair ðŸ¦½)

Macroses for WTD Survival in active works.
